##### AMAB

Assinged Male At Birth.

Usually AMABs have anatomically male bodies at birth but intersex people are sometimes AMAB.

##### AFAB

Assigned Female At Birth.

Usually AFABs have anatomically female bodies at birth but some intersex babies are AFAB either because of how their genitalia looked at birth or because the doctors found it easier to convert the baby's ambiguous genitalia into a vagina.

In extreme cases, babies whose circumcision was botched are sort of AFAB as their male status is quickly erased from records or was never oficialized as the birth certificate is sometimes done after any circumcision.
