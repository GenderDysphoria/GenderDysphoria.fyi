<!-- # Estrogenic Second Puberty 101 -->
# 雌激素性第二青春期 101

<!-- ## What To Expect from Feminizing HRT -->
## 女性化 HRT 的預期變化

<!-- This is a compilation of reported medical transition changes collected from testimonials of AMAB trans people taking estrogen-based hormone therapy. This information is gathered from social media and chat rooms. Yes, that means this is all anecdotal, but historically, most of transgender medical study is anecdotal because no one wants to fund transgender medical research. -->
這是從接受以雌激素為基礎的激素療法的出生時指定性別為男性的跨性別者的證詞中收集的已報告的醫療轉變變化的彙編。這些資訊是從社交媒體和聊天室收集的。是的，這意味著這些都是軼事，但從歷史上看，大多數跨性別醫學研究都是軼事，因為沒有人願意資助跨性別醫學研究。

<!-- **Note that this is a list of _possible_ changes. There is no guarantee that every person on feminizing HRT will experience all of these. Your age, genetics, medical history, degree of masculinization from natal puberty, and hormone regimen can all have impacts on results. There is also just a degree of randomness — every body is different — and some things can take years to appear.** -->
**請注意，這是一個*可能*發生的變化的清單。不能保證每個接受女性化 HRT 的人都会經歷所有這些變化。你的年齡、基因、病史、原生青春期的男性化程度以及激素療法方案都會對結果產生影響。也存在一定程度的隨機性——每個人的身體都是不同的——有些事情可能需要數年的時間才會出現。**

<!-- ### Breast Growth -->
### 乳房發育

<!-- Despite public perceptions, the majority of transfems do not pursue breast augmentation, as it often isn't necessary (and, for many, is not within reach). Every human is born with breast tissue, it simply remains inactive without estrogen to make it grow. Development typically takes 2-5 years, but can continue for more than ten years, just as it does for cisgender women. -->
儘管公眾的認知如此，但大多數跨性別女性並不會追求隆乳，因為這通常沒有必要（而且，對許多人來說，也遙不可及）。每個人出生時都有乳房組織，只是在沒有雌激素使其生長的情況下，它會保持休眠狀態。發育通常需要 2-5 年的時間，但可以持續十多年，就像順性別女性一樣。

<!-- Expect aches and pains in the chest, along with lots of tenderness in the area surrounding and behind the areola. Avoid bumping into anything, as it *will* hurt. Nipples and areolae will become much more sensitive while also becoming larger and darker. You'll want to invest in some sports bras. -->
預計胸部會出現疼痛，乳暈周圍和後面的區域會非常容易有壓痛。避免撞到任何東西，因為它*會*很痛。乳頭和乳暈會變得更加敏感，同時也會變得更大、顏色更深。你需要投資一些運動內衣。

<!-- This may be accompanied with lactation. Some secretion is normal and can be expected as milk ducts form and open up, so there is no cause for alarm. However, significant discharge without intentional stimulation may be a sign of a prolactin imbalance, so you should tell your doctor if this happens. -->
這可能伴隨著泌乳。一些分泌物是正常的，在乳腺管形成和打開時是可以預期的，所以沒有必要驚慌。然而，沒有刻意刺激的情況下出現大量分泌物可能是催乳素(prolactin)失衡的跡象，所以如果發生這種情況，你應該告訴你的醫生。

<!-- ### Skin Softening -->
### 皮膚變柔軟

<!-- Testosterone promotes the thickening and toughening of the epidermis, so removing it makes the skin thinner. Additionally, estrogen promotes the production of collagen, which causes skin to become softer and more iridescent. Expect to see more varicose veins on your legs. Tattoos that may have faded over time might become bolder and clearer. -->
睪固酮會促進表皮變厚和變硬，因此去除它會使皮膚變薄。此外，雌激素會促進膠原蛋白的產生，使皮膚變得更柔軟、更有光澤。預計你的腿上會出現更多的靜脈曲張。隨著時間的推移，褪色的紋身可能會變得更清晰、更醒目。

<!-- The removal of testosterone also causes a severe drop in skin oils, particularly on the face and scalp. This results in a significant reduction of acne and/or dandruff. -->
去除睪固酮還會導致皮膚油脂急劇減少，尤其是在臉部和頭皮上。這會導致粉刺和/或頭皮屑顯著減少。

<!-- ### Increased Flexibility -->
### 柔韌性增加

<!-- Testosterone causes water retention in ligaments and tendons, rendering them less stretchable. Removing androgens from the body causes the tendons to release those fluids and regain their elasticity. -->
睪固酮會導致韌帶和肌腱儲水，使它們的伸展性降低。從體內去除雄激素會導致肌腱釋放這些液體並恢復彈性。

<!-- ### Slimmer Hands and Wrists -->
### 更纖細的手和手腕

{!{
<div class="gutter flex">
{{import '~/img' images.hands className="card" caption="作者的手。這種變化發生在三年半的時間裡。"}}
</div>
}!}

<!-- As the skin begins to soften and slim down, the hands gradually begin to shrink. Without testosterone, less blood flows to the hands, causing further reduction in tissue sizes. Ring size will drop as fat and fluids move off the fingers. Finger length shortens as ligaments thin and stretch. -->
隨著皮膚開始變軟和變薄，手會逐漸變小。沒有睪固酮，流向手的血液會減少，導致組織尺寸進一步縮小。隨著脂肪和液體從手指上移走，戒指尺寸會變小。隨著韌帶變薄和拉伸，手指長度會縮短。

<!-- ### Smaller Feet -->
### 更小的腳

<!-- Much like hands, the feet also experience changes in shape. Androgens encourage more blood flow to the feet, and encourage water build up in cartilage. Estrogens allow the ligaments in the foot to stretch more. Collectively, this causes the arch of the foot to increase, shortening its total length by as much as two centimeters. Many people report a drop of one to two shoe sizes. -->
與手很像，腳的形狀也會發生變化。雄激素會促進更多的血液流向腳部，並促進軟骨中的水分積聚。雌激素會使腳部的韌帶伸展得更多。總的來說，這會導致足弓增加，使腳的總長度縮短多達兩厘米。許多人報告說，他們的鞋子減少了一到兩個尺碼。

<!-- ### Thinner & Softer Fingernails -->
### 更薄、更軟的指甲

<!-- Fingernails are made of keratin, and many keratin genes are activated by androgen receptors, thus causing thicker fingernails. The loss of testosterone will make the nails thinner and more prone to breakage. -->
指甲是由角蛋白構成的，許多角蛋白基因是由雄激素受體啟動的，因此會導致指甲變厚。睪固酮的減少會使指甲變薄，更容易斷裂。

<!-- ### Reduced Body Hair -->
### 體毛減少

<!-- Do not expect a total cessation of body hair; once the follicles are made terminal by DHT, they remain that way. However, much like fingernails, hair thickness is an expression of keratin genes activated by androgens. Removing testosterone causes the body hairs to become thinner and lighter. Genetics plays a major role in this, however. -->
不要期望體毛完全停止生長；一旦毛囊被 DHT 變成永久性的，它們就會保持這種狀態。然而，就像指甲一樣，毛髮的粗細是由雄激素激活的角蛋白基因的表達。去除睪固酮會導致體毛變薄和變淺。然而，基因在這方面起著重要作用。

<!-- ### Changes in Body Temperature Placement -->
### 體溫分佈的變化

<!-- Androgens encourage extra blood flow to extremities, making them warmer. Because of this, women tend to have warmer core temperatures but lower oral and surface level temperatures. You may see your basal body temperature drop to around 97.6°F (36.4°C). -->
雄激素會促進血液流向四肢，使它們變暖。因此，女性的核心體溫往往更高，但口腔和表層體溫更低。你可能會看到你的基礎體溫下降到 97.6°F (36.4°C) 左右。

<!-- This, unfortunately, results in a reduced tolerance to cold, so expect to need to layer clothing more frequently, especially since many buildings [set their thermostats for male comfort levels](https://www.popsci.com/study-finds-gender-bias-office-air-conditioning/). -->
不幸的是，這會導致對寒冷的耐受性降低，因此預計需要更頻繁地穿多層衣服，尤其是在許多建築物[將恆溫器設定為男性的舒適水平](https://www.popsci.com/study-finds-gender-bias-office-air-conditioning/)（英文）的情況下。

<!-- ### Changes in Perspiration Patterns -->
### 排汗模式的變化

<!-- With the above shift in temperature distribution, this also results in a significant change in how one sweats. Sweat becomes more of a full body experience, as opposed to being largely centered on the head and armpits. Underboob sweat becomes a thing. -->
隨著上述體溫分佈的變化，排汗的方式也會發生重大變化。出汗變成了一種全身性的體驗，而不是主要集中在頭部和腋窩。乳房下方的汗水變成了一種常見現象。

<!-- ### Reduction and/or Change of Body Odor -->
### 體味減少和/或改變

<!-- A major component in male body odor is the presence of [the steroid pheromone androstadienone](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070916143523.htm) in sweat. Androstadienone is metabolized directly from testosterone, so halting testosterone removes the source. Without it, sweat takes on a much sweeter smell, which is often attributed to feminine odors. -->
男性體味的一個主要成分是汗水中[類固醇費洛蒙雄甾二烯酮](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070916143523.htm)（英文）的存在。雄甾二烯酮是直接由睪固酮代謝而來的，因此停止服用睪固酮會去除其來源。沒有它，汗水會散發出一種更甜的氣味，這通常被認為是女性的氣味。

<!-- People taking spironolactone may experience a total cessation of any body odor due to the way the drug alters cortisol uptake within the body. -->
服用螺環固醇內酮(spironolactone)的人可能會因為藥物改變了體內皮質醇的吸收方式而完全沒有體味。

<!-- ### Reduced Muscle Mass -->
### 肌肉量減少

<!-- Androgens stimulate muscle growth, which is why anabolic steroids (which are literally testosterone) are so common amongst bodybuilders. People running on androgens naturally have more muscle mass, particularly in the upper body, without even having to work out. Removing androgens causes that muscle mass to atrophy and makes it harder to gain muscle. This is a major contributor to the feminine shoulder and neck line, as well as the waist line. -->
雄激素會刺激肌肉生長，這就是為什麼合成代謝類固醇（實際上就是睪固酮）在健美運動員中如此普遍的原因。即使不運動，使用雄激素的人自然會有更多的肌肉量，尤其是在上半身。去除雄激素會導致肌肉萎縮，並且更難增加肌肉。這是女性肩膀和頸部線條以及腰圍線條的一個主要因素。

<!-- With this comes a significant loss in strength. Carrying things becomes more difficult, pickle jars become harder to open. -->
隨之而來的是力量的顯著下降。搬運東西變得更加困難，打開酸黃瓜罐也變得更加困難。

<!-- ### Fat Redistribution into Feminine Proportions -->
### 脂肪重新分佈成女性比例

<!-- Androgens encourage the body to deposit fats into the abdomen, while estrogen encourages the body to deposit fats into the thighs, buttocks, and hips. Switching profiles causes new fats to be deposited according to the estrogen profile, and fats that were stored while on androgens break down. This produces the illusion of fat migration as the shape of the body changes. The waistline shrinks and defines itself below the ribs, and the belly becomes softer and flatter. -->
雄激素會促進身體將脂肪沉積到腹部，而雌激素則會促進身體將脂肪沉積到大腿、臀部和臀部。改變荷爾蒙曲線會導致新的脂肪根據雌激素曲線沉積，而儲存在雄激素上的脂肪會分解。隨著體型的變化，這會產生脂肪遷移的錯覺。腰圍會縮小，並在肋骨下方形成清晰的線條，腹部會變得更柔軟、更平坦。

<!-- Because estrogen deposits weight much lower on the body, and the muscle mass in the upper body is lost, this lowers the center of gravity, which alters one's walking gait. It becomes more natural to cantilever the body with the hips while walking, as opposed to the shoulders. -->
由於雌激素將脂肪沉積在身體的更下方，而上半身的肌肉量會減少，這會降低重心，從而改變人的行走步態。行走時，用臀部而不是肩膀來保持身體平衡會變得更自然。

<!-- ### Facial Feature Changes -->
### 面部特徵的變化

<!-- Along with body fat migration, fat in the face also migrates. The neck, chin, and jawline thin out while the lips and upper cheeks puff up. The brow and upper eyelids lift, exposing more of the eyeball. Changes in skin and musculature around the eye can alter the shape of the eyeball, changing focal depth and altering vision clarity. The color of the eyes may also change and become bolder, as testosterone causes the pigmentation in the iris to fade. -->
隨著體脂的遷移，臉部的脂肪也會遷移。頸部、下巴和下顎線會變細，而嘴唇和上臉頰會變豐滿。眉毛和上眼瞼會提升，露出更多的眼球。眼睛周圍皮膚和肌肉的變化會改變眼球的形狀，改變焦深並影響視力清晰度。隨著睪固酮導致虹膜中的色素沉澱褪色，眼睛的顏色也可能會改變，變得更醒目。

<!-- This is an extremely subtle and slow moving process that takes years, and it is easy to think nothing is changing at all. Take selfies to compare. -->
這是一個非常微妙且緩慢的過程，需要數年的時間，而且很容易認為什麼都沒有改變。拍自拍照來對照。

<!-- ### Changes to Scalp Hair -->
### 頭皮毛髮的變化

<!-- With the removal of androgens, blood flow to the scalp increases. Follicles that had been lost to male pattern baldness may reactivate, causing some return of the hairline and a filling-in of bald spots. Scalp hair becomes thicker and follicles grow stronger, allowing hair to grow to longer lengths. -->
隨著雄激素的去除，流向頭皮的血液會增加。因男性型禿髮而失去的毛囊可能會重新啟動，導致髮際線有所恢復，禿斑處長出頭髮。頭皮毛髮會變粗，毛囊會變得更強壯，使頭髮能夠長得更長。

<!-- With this thickening, curliness may become more pronounced, and a change in hair color may also occur. You might find your hair taking on a texture more like your mother's than your father's. -->
隨著頭髮變粗，捲髮可能會變得更明顯，頭髮的顏色也可能會發生變化。你可能會發現你的頭髮質地更像你母親的，而不是你父親的。

<!-- ### [Anterior Pelvic Tilt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_tilt) -->
### [骨盆前傾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_tilt)（英文）

<!-- As musculature atrophies, ligament flexibility increases, and weight shifts lower on the body, the orientation of the pelvic bone in relation to the spine and femurs rotates forward — not by much (only about 10-20 degrees), but enough to cause a change in the alignment of the spine and hips, increasing the arch of the back and causing the buttocks to jut out more. The added arch to the back can cause a relative drop in total height, between 1 and 2 inches (2-5 cm) depending on pelvic shape. -->
隨著肌肉萎縮、韌帶柔韌性增加以及脂肪向下半身移動，骨盆與脊柱和股骨的相對位置會向前旋轉——幅度不大（只有 10-20 度左右），但足以導致脊柱和臀部的排列發生變化，增加背部的弧度，使臀部更加突出。背部弧度的增加會導致身高相對降低，根據骨盆形狀的不同，降低幅度在 1 到 2 英寸（2-5 公分）之間。

<!-- Note: this is NOT the same as the hip rotation that occurs in AFAB puberty and during pregnancy. That is the result of migration of bone cells, altering the shape of the pelvic bone itself. **However**, hip rotation *can* occur if the person is young enough to still be within initial puberty, where the body is producing elevated human growth hormone. There have also been examples of hip rotation happening over long periods of time in trans elders. In 2017 an 80 year old trans woman reported on reddit that over the course of her 30 years on HRT, her doctor observed changes in her pelvis consistent with female hip rotation. -->
注意：這與出生指定性別女性(AFAB)的青春期和懷孕期間發生的臀部旋轉不同。那是骨細胞遷移的結果，改變了骨盆本身的形狀。*然而*，如果當事人足夠年輕，仍在初始青春期內，身體產生大量的人體生長激素，那麼臀部旋轉*可能會*發生。也有跨性別長者在很長一段時間內發生臀部旋轉的例子。2017 年，一位 80 歲的跨性別女性在 Reddit 上報告說，在她接受 HRT 治療的 30 年裡，她的醫生觀察到她的骨盆發生了與女性臀部旋轉一致的變化。

<!-- ### Reduced Tolerance of Caffeine, Alcohol, and/or Psychotropics -->
### 對咖啡因、酒精和/或精神藥物的耐受性降低

<!-- Less body mass means less blood to dilute chemicals into. Losing testosterone also means a slower metabolic rate, decreasing the speed at which toxins are reduced from the bloodstream. Some anti-androgens also put strain on the liver, further reducing how quickly chemicals are processed. -->
較少的體重意味著較少的血液來稀釋化學物質。失去睪固酮也意味著新陳代謝速度減慢，降低了毒素從血液中清除的速度。一些抗雄激素還會對肝臟造成壓力，進一步降低化學物質的處理速度。

<!-- ### Mental Changes -->
### 心理變化

<!-- As covered in the Biochemical Dysphoria section, brains can be wired for a certain hormone profile, and running on the wrong profile is like using a laptop with low batteries or an overheated processor. Starting HRT almost universally results in a cessation of depersonalization and derealization (DPDR) symptoms within the first two weeks. A mental fog lifts, and it becomes easier to concentrate on complex concepts (assuming you don't also have other mental processing difficulties such as ADHD). -->
正如生化不安一節中所述，大腦可以根據特定的荷爾蒙曲線連接，而使用錯誤的荷爾蒙曲線就像使用電池電量低或處理器過熱的筆電一樣。開始 HRT 幾乎普遍會導致在最初兩週內停止人格解體和現實解體 (DPDR) 症狀。大腦的迷霧消散了，更容易集中注意力思考複雜的概念（假設你沒有其他心理處理困難，例如注意力不足過動症(ADHD)）。

<!-- ##### ADHD -->
##### 注意力不足過動症(ADHD)

<!-- If you have ADHD, there may be some changes in your symptoms. Androgens amplify [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) receptor function, so reducing testosterone can reduce the activation potential for dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the behavior of [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), the short-term memory of the brain. Less working memory means you become more prone to distractions and have more difficulty maintaining [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load). -->
如果你患有注意力不足過動症，你的症狀可能會有一些變化。雄激素會放大[多巴胺](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%9A%E5%B7%B4%E8%83%BA)受體的功能，因此減少睪固酮會降低大腦中多巴胺的激活潛力。多巴胺是[工作記憶](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E8%AE%B0%E5%BF%86)（大腦的短期記憶）行為中的關鍵神經遞質。較少的工作記憶意味著你更容易分心，更難以保持[認知負荷](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AA%8D%E7%9F%A5%E8%B2%A0%E8%8D%B7)（英文）。

<!-- The good news is that estradiol prompts the brain to produce MORE dopamine. -->
好消息是，雌二醇會促使大腦產生*更多*的多巴胺。

{!{ <div class="gutter flex" style="justify-content: flex-end"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title">作者註：</h4> }!}

<!-- There is a known problem with spironolactone hampering working memory due to its effects on mineralocorticoids. This can significantly worsen ADHD issues and make it much harder to maintain focus or be aware of your surroundings. I was involved in a car accident in 2017 that I blame on spiro fog. -->
由於螺環固醇內酮(spironolactone)對鹽皮質激素的影響，已知它會損害工作記憶。這會顯著加劇注意力不足過動症的問題，並使你更難集中注意力或意識到周圍的環境。2017 年，我發生了一起車禍，我認為這是螺環固醇內酮造成的。

{!{ </div></div></div> }!}

<!-- ##### Emotional Expansion -->
##### 情緒擴張

<!-- The alleviation of DPDR almost universally is accompanied with a much broader capacity for emotion and expression. The stoicism and dissociation lifts and emotions land with much greater intensity. Highs are higher and lows are lower. Those who may have been unable to cry before transition gain it back, both for sadness and for joy. -->
DPDR 的緩解幾乎普遍伴隨著更廣泛的情緒和表達能力。冷漠和分離感消失了，情緒以更大的強度襲來。高潮更高，低谷更低。那些在轉變前無法哭泣的人重新獲得了哭泣的能力，無論是悲傷還是喜悅。

<!-- Unfortunately, this also means that, if you had trauma from events earlier in life (and who doesn't), you may start to experience PTSD episodes. This is why it is good (and, in some places, required) to have a therapist. -->
不幸的是，這也意味著，如果你在早年生活中經歷過創傷（誰沒有呢？），你可能會開始經歷創傷後壓力症候群 (PTSD) 發作。這就是為什麼擁有一個治療師是好的（在某些地方是必需的）。

<!-- ##### Mood Swings -->
##### 情緒波動

<!-- As estrogen levels fluctuate between doses, you may experience noticeable and sometimes dramatic shifts in your mood. Unexplained crying happens; PMS rage happens; be ready for it. -->
由於雌激素水平在劑量之間波動，你可能會經歷明顯的、有時是戲劇性的情緒變化。莫名其妙的哭泣會發生；經前症候群(PMS)的憤怒會發生；做好準備。

<!-- ##### Appetite -->
##### 食慾

<!-- Many people report being unable to eat as much as they could pre-transition. The loss of lean muscle in the arms and shoulders means that the body has a reduced capacity for burning lipids, and as such the fullness sensation occurs earlier. -->
許多人報告說，他們無法像轉變前那樣吃那麼多東西。手臂和肩膀上肌肉的減少意味著身體燃燒脂質的能力降低，因此飽腹感會更早出現。

<!-- However, progesterone increases mitochondrial function within the body, boosting metabolic rate. This can cause an increase in appetite as the body attempts to replenish calories burned. -->
然而，黃體素(progesterone)會增強體內的粒線體功能，提高新陳代謝率。隨著身體試圖補充燃燒的卡路里，這可能會導致食慾增加。

<!-- That said, you may find yourself unable to eat *as much* food as you could before. Many report that they become full/satisfied sooner than before. -->
也就是說，你可能會發現自己無法像以前那樣吃 *那麼多* 東西。許多人報告說，他們比以前更快感到飽/滿足。

<!-- ##### Sleep -->
##### 睡眠

<!-- Many people report having better sleep patterns after starting HRT. This is likely a factor of the alleviation of DPDR, as it seems to occur in both AMAB and AFAB trans people. That said, initiating progesterone can *significantly* improve sleep, allowing for deeper sleep and more dreaming. -->
許多人報告說，開始 HRT 後，他們的睡眠模式得到了改善。這可能是 DPDR 緩解的一個因素，因為它似乎發生在出生時指定性別為男性和出生時指定性別為女性的跨性別者身上。也就是說，開始服用黃體素可以*顯著*改善睡眠，使睡眠更深沉，更容易做夢。

<!-- ##### Extroversion -->
##### 外向性

<!-- It's extremely common for trans people of all types to find themselves much more sociable post-transition. This may not actually be a factor of hormone therapy, however, and may simply be a result of no longer having to suppress large portions of their personality. -->
各種跨性別者在轉變後發現自己更善於交際是非常普遍的。然而，這可能實際上不是激素治療的一個因素，而可能只是不再需要壓抑自己大部分個性的結果。

<!-- ### Sensory Enhancements -->
### 感官增強

<!-- Transgender HRT has [been shown several times](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/5/1582/3064956) to cause changes in the distribution of gray matter and white matter within the brain for trans people on both forms of HRT. New structures and neuro-pathways are formed as a result of the shift in hormone profiles, and this results in changes of sensory perception. These are some of the changes that have been observed and reported, but it is not clear if this is a function of the hormones themselves, or a factor of the brain receiving the hormones it is wired for. -->
跨性別 HRT 已經[多次被證明](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/28/5/1582/3064956)（英文）會導致兩種形式的 HRT 中跨性別者的大腦灰質和白質分佈發生變化。由於荷爾蒙曲線的變化，會形成新的結構和神經通路，這會導致感官知覺的變化。以下是一些已被觀察和報告的變化，但尚不清楚這是荷爾蒙本身的功能，還是大腦接收到它所連接的荷爾蒙的一個因素。

<!-- - **Improved sense of smell**, especially of other bodies. Human sweat becomes very discernible — even overpowering at times.
- **Improved color perception**. Colors may become bolder, richer.
- **Improved spatial awareness**. Many trans people experience poor proprioception and a tendency towards clumsiness that goes away after starting HRT.
- **Changes in perception of taste**. Certain foods become more or less palatable; cilantro, for example, may become more or less soapy. Increased tolerance of capsaicin (spicy peppers). Chocolate and wine become more flavorful. -->
- **嗅覺改善**，尤其是對其他身體的嗅覺。人體的汗水變得非常容易辨別——有時甚至非常強烈。
- **顏色感知改善**。顏色可能會變得更醒目、更飽滿。
- **空間感知改善**。許多跨性別者經歷過本體感覺不良和笨拙的傾向，這些症狀在開始 HRT 後就消失了。
- **味覺的變化**。某些食物變得更可口或更不可口；例如，芫荽可能會變得更有肥皂味或更少肥皂味。對辣椒素（辣椒）的耐受性增加。巧克力和葡萄酒的味道變得更好。

<!-- Users of spironolactone often develop strong cravings for foods high in salt, such as pickles, olives, or potato products. This is because spiro is a potassium-sparing diuretic which causes you to pee out all your sodium. The brain creates cravings to encourage you to replace that sodium. -->
螺環固醇內酮的使用者通常會對高鹽食物產生強烈的渴望，例如泡菜、橄欖或馬鈴薯製品。這是因為螺環固醇內酮是一種保鉀利尿劑，它會導致你排出所有的鈉。大腦會產生渴望，促使你補充鈉。

<!-- ### Spatial Shift, Reduced Confidence -->
### 空間變化，自信心下降

<!-- There is a very frequently reported experience of feeling smaller within the world, even when wearing heels. People taller than you seem to tower over you, and spaces feel larger. -->
有一種非常常見的經歷，那就是感覺自己在世界上的體型變小了，即使穿著高跟鞋也是如此。比你高的人似乎高你很多，空間感覺更大。

<!-- People have also reported a tendency to be less prone to start arguments, as well as a desire to avoid confrontation rather than create it. Testosterone has been shown to increase a person's sense of confidence, and removing it has the opposite effect. -->
人們還報告說，他們不太容易發起爭論，並且希望避免衝突而不是製造衝突。睪固酮已被證明可以增加一個人的自信心，而去除它則會產生相反的效果。

<!-- ### Genital Changes -->
### 生殖器變化

{!{
<div class="gutter flex">
{{import '~/img' images.homology link='https://www.vielma.at/' }}
</div>
}!}

<!-- All genitalia are constructed from the same tissues; they are merely organized differently during gestation. Much of the behavior of these tissues is regulated by the hormones one's body runs on. Skin secretions, textures, sensitivity and erectile behavior are all hormonal expressions, which means that when you remove androgens and add estrogens, these tissues start acting like they are in the shape of a vulva, even though they aren't. -->
所有生殖器都是由相同的組織構成的；它們只是在妊娠期間的組織方式不同。這些組織的許多行為都受到一個人身體運作的荷爾蒙的調節。皮膚分泌物、質地、敏感性和勃起行為都是荷爾蒙的表達，這意味著，當你去除雄激素並添加雌激素時，這些組織就會開始像外陰一樣活動，即使它們不是外陰。

<!-- ##### Increased Sensitivity -->
##### 敏感性增加

<!-- The skin on the glans and shaft becomes much thinner and fragile, more prone to tearing and irritation, while also becoming *significantly* more sensitive to touch. The entire organ also becomes much more sensitive to pressure, and vibration becomes a better form of stimulation over stroking, which may become painful. -->
龜頭和陰莖桿上的皮膚變得更薄、更脆弱，更容易撕裂和刺激，同時也變得*明顯*更敏感。整個器官也變得對壓力更敏感，振動比撫摸更能刺激，撫摸可能會變得疼痛。

<!-- #### Moisture and Feminine Odor -->
#### 濕潤和女性氣味

<!-- The skin along the shaft begins to secrete the same fluids as the vaginal canal, particularly during arousal (yes, trans girls get wet). These fluids encourage the development of the same microbiome that develops within the vaginal canal. The combination of these factors means that odor (and taste) of the penis changes to align more to that of a vulva.  -->
陰莖桿上的皮膚開始分泌與陰道相同的液體，尤其是在興奮時（是的，跨性別女孩也會濕）。這些液體會促進與陰道內相同的微生物群的發展。這些因素的結合意味著陰莖的氣味（和味道）會發生變化，更接近於外陰。

<!-- ##### Color and Texture Changes -->
##### 顏色和質地的變化

<!-- The scrotum is an analog of the outer and inner labia, and takes on a softer, more velvety texture, extending down into the perineum. The skin along the perineal raphe (the vertical line where the vulva opening had been before the scrotum formed) will also darken. Some people experience a kind of striping pattern along the scrotum. -->
陰囊是大陰唇和小陰唇的類似物，質地變得更柔軟、更像天鵝絨，向下延伸到會陰。會陰縫（陰囊形成前外陰開口所在的垂直線）的皮膚也會變黑。有些人會在陰囊上出現一種條紋圖案。

<!-- ##### Fewer Erections -->
##### 勃起減少

<!-- Without free-floating testosterone, the levels of [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) in the bloodstream drop significantly. DHT plays a major role in the stimulation of random erections during sleep through the enlargement of the prostate, and these erections are what is responsible for the maintenance of the erectile tissue. Without DHT, the prostate shrinks again, and random erections cease (no more morning wood). -->
沒有游離的睪固酮，血液中[DHT](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%8C%E6%B0%A2%E7%9D%BE%E9%85%AE) 的水平會顯著下降。DHT 透過前列腺的增大，在睡眠期間隨機勃起的刺激中起著重要作用，而這些勃起是維持勃起組織的原因。沒有 DHT，前列腺會再次萎縮，隨機勃起也會停止（不再有晨勃）。

<!-- However, this means that the erectile tissue will begin to atrophy. Prolonged atrophy will result in shrinkage of the entire organ, for better or worse. The shape of the penis changes as this occurs, often becoming more conical. The glans is the first part to shrink and may lose the ability to become rigid. Penetrative sex may become more difficult, and erections themselves may become painful. -->
然而，這意味著勃起組織將開始萎縮。長時間的萎縮會導致整個器官萎縮，無論好壞。陰莖的形狀會隨著萎縮而發生變化，通常會變得更像圓錐形。龜頭是最先萎縮的部分，可能會失去勃起的能力。插入式性交可能會變得更加困難，勃起本身也可能會變得疼痛。

<!-- This can be countered by regularly inducing erections, but that may become more and more difficult as time goes on. -->
這可以透過定期勃起來抵消，但隨著時間的推移，這可能會變得越來越困難。

<!-- ##### Clear Ejaculate -->
##### 透明的精液

<!-- The majority of the liquid that makes up ejaculate originates in the prostate. It is a completely clear fluid, with a slimy texture. The white color and stickiness that is usually attributed to male ejaculate is caused by semen and seminal fluid from the testicles. The production of both semen and seminal fluid is a product of testicle function, so as the testicles shut down (either because of anti-androgens or from estrogen dominance), these fluids halt, leaving only the prostate fluid. -->
組成精液的大部分液體都來自前列腺。它是一種完全透明的液體，質地黏稠。通常被認為是男性精液的白色和黏性是由睪丸中的精子和精液引起的。精子和精液的產生都是睪丸功能的產物，因此隨著睪丸停止運作（由於抗雄激素或雌激素佔優勢），這些液體會停止，只剩下前列腺液。

<!-- Some people lose even that, and stop having any emissions at all during orgasm. -->
有些人甚至連前列腺液都失去了，在性高潮時根本沒有任何分泌物。

<!-- Needless to say, this comes with sterility. Contrary to what some sources report, this is NOT permanent, and many people have been able to restore testicle functionality by halting hormone therapy, either for detransition or for reproductive purposes. -->
不用說，這會導致不育。與一些資料來源的報導相反，這*不是*永久性的，許多人能夠透過停止激素治療來恢復睪丸的功能，無論是為了去轉變還是為了生育。

<!-- ##### Testicle Atrophy -->
##### 睪丸萎縮

<!-- Once the testes have stopped functioning, the cells start to atrophy, shrinking over time. This atrophy may be accompanied with pain, sometimes in the form of a soreness or a dull throbbing sensation, or sometimes as registering as little sparks of pain that travel along the perineal nerve from the testicles down to the rectum. -->
一旦睪丸停止運作，細胞就會開始萎縮，隨著時間的推移而縮小。這種萎縮可能伴隨著疼痛，有時表現為酸痛或鈍痛，有時表現為沿著會陰神經從睪丸到直腸的小小刺痛。

<!-- ### Sexual Changes -->
### 性方面的變化

<!-- Initial start of HRT may result in a total loss of sex drive as testosterone levels plummet. This can last 3-12 months, and, in some cases, doesn't return at all. Starting progesterone often serves as a catalyst for its return. If/when sex drive comes back, the new libido [may be a completely different experience](https://curvyandtrans.com/p/5BF1EA/libatious-libidos) that one may not recognize at first. -->
隨著睪固酮水平的急劇下降，開始 HRT 的初期可能會導致性慾完全喪失。這可能持續 3-12 個月，在某些情況下，根本不會恢復。開始服用黃體酮通常可以作為其恢復的催化劑。如果/當性慾恢復時，新的性慾[可能是一種完全不同的體驗](https://curvyandtrans.com/p/5BF1EA/libatious-libidos)（英文），一開始你可能認不出來。

<!-- ##### Heightened Erogenous Zones -->
##### 敏感帶增強

<!-- The entire body becomes more responsive to touch, and with that unlocks stronger erogenous zones. Breasts, abdomen, inner thighs, and neck, in particular, become more arousal-inducing. -->
整個身體對觸摸的反應變得更加敏感，隨之而來的是更強的敏感帶。乳房、腹部、大腿內側和頸部尤其更容易引起性興奮。

<!-- ##### Orgasm -->
##### 性高潮

<!-- Orgasm changes significantly, both in the way it builds and how it is experienced (see link above), but additionally, if one is lucky, they will gain the ability to become multi-orgasmic with no refractory period. The cost of this is that orgasm may become harder to achieve, and one has to re-learn how to reach it. It also becomes easier to reach with a partner, which may have been the opposite before. -->
性高潮會發生顯著變化，無論是在它的積累方式還是在體驗方式上（見上面的連結），但此外，如果一個人幸運的話，他們將獲得沒有不應期的多次性高潮的能力。這樣做的代價是性高潮可能變得更難達到，而且必須重新學習如何達到性高潮。與伴侶一起達到性高潮也變得更容易了，這在以前可能是相反的。

<!-- ##### Attraction -->
##### 吸引力

<!-- It is [not at all unheard of](https://www.them.us/story/sexual-attraction-after-transition) for a transgender person to experience a change in their sexual orientation with transition. This is almost always the result of the removal of self-imposed mental barriers, but hormone therapy often plays a role *in* that removal. In most cases this simply involves an expansion of ones attraction, from monosexual to bi/pansexual, but some people also discover that their attraction was largely rooted in self-interest and that their true attraction is reversed. -->
跨性別者在轉變過程中經歷性取向的改變[並不少見](https://www.them.us/story/sexual-attraction-after-transition)（英文）。這幾乎總是去除自我強加的心理障礙的結果，但激素治療通常在去除這些障礙的過程中起作用。在大多數情況下，這只是擴展了一個人的吸引力，從單性戀到雙性戀/泛性戀，但也有一些人發現，他們的吸引力很大程度上源於自身利益，而他們真正的吸引力是相反的。

<!-- ### Cyclical Period-like Symptoms -->
### 週期性類似經期症狀

<!-- Obviously, we do not mean blood flow; that would be ludicrous. Symptoms vary greatly (just as they do in cisgender women) and typically last for 2-4 days, repeating every 26-32 days (though some report experiencing it every two weeks). This happens independent of medication dosing schedules. The use of a period tracker app like Clue can reveal the pattern. -->
顯然，我們指的不是血液流動；那就太荒謬了。症狀變化很大（就像順性別女性一樣），通常持續 2-4 天，每 26-32 天重複一次（儘管有些人報告說每兩週經歷一次）。這與藥物劑量時間表無關。使用像 Clue 這樣的經期追蹤應用程式可以顯示這種模式。

<!-- - Cramping in the intestine and abdominal muscles, ranging from a slight flutter in the gut to strong painful spasms.
- Bloating and water retention
- Gas, diarrhea and other intestinal issues.
- Emotional instability, mood swings and irrational thoughts
  - Heightened depression and dysmorphia
  - Depersonalization or dissociation.
  - Increased dysphoria
  - Irritability (PMS)
- Muscle and joint aches and pains
- Breast engorgement and nipple tenderness
- Acne
- Fatigue
- Appetite changes and spontaneous cravings (see: chocolate cravings)
- Spontaneous shifts in libido
- Changes in genital odor -->
- 腸道和腹部肌肉痙攣，從輕微的腸道顫動到劇烈的疼痛性痙攣。
- 腹脹和水腫
- 脹氣、腹瀉和其他腸道問題。
- 情緒不穩定、情緒波動和非理性想法
  - 抑鬱和身體畸形加劇
  - 人格解體或現實解體。
  - 性別不安加劇
  - 易怒（經前症候群）
- 肌肉和關節疼痛
- 乳房腫脹和乳頭壓痛
- 粉刺
- 疲勞
- 食慾變化和自發性渴望（例如：巧克力渴望）
- 性慾的自發性變化
- 生殖器氣味的變化

<!-- No, there have not yet been studies on this yet, but it is reported by far, **far** too many individuals to be an anomaly (including by yours truly), and has been confirmed by multiple people's own doctors. There is also precedent of this happening with cisgender women who have had hysterectomies (I personally know two cisgender women who have cycles but do not menstruate, without any medical intervention). -->
不，目前還沒有關於這方面的研究，但有太多太多的人報告說這是一種異常現象（包括我自己），而且已經得到多位醫生證實。順性別女性在切除子宮後也會出現這種情況（我個人認識兩位順性別女性，她們有月經週期，但沒有月經，沒有任何醫療干預）。

<!-- Running on estrogen and progesterone activates a gene sequence which instructs the hypothalamus to attempt to cycle ovary and uterine behavior just as it does in female-assigned individuals, regardless of the absence of ovaries or a uterus. This cycle affects numerous organs and subsystems in the body, causing the release of a variety of different hormones and enzymes that can affect function and even behavior. -->
使用雌激素和黃體酮會激活一個基因序列，指示下視丘試圖像在女性指定個體中一樣循環卵巢和子宮的行為，而不管卵巢或子宮是否存在。這個週期會影響身體的許多器官和子系統，導致釋放各種不同的荷爾蒙和酶，這些荷爾蒙和酶會影響功能，甚至行為。

<!-- A more thorough explanation of this will be coming in a later update to the site. -->
關於這方面的更詳細的解釋將在網站的後續更新中提供。
