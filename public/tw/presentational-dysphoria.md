<!-- # Presentational Dysphoria -->

# 表現不安

<!-- Clothes. Hair. Makeup. Jewelry. Glasses. Piercings and other body modifications. Even personal hygiene can be a factor of presentation, such as the shaving of body hair or how you take care of your skin. All of these things are gendered in society, clothing and hair especially. -->

服裝、髮型、化妝、珠寶、眼鏡、穿孔和其他身體改造。即使是個人衛生也可能是表現的一個因素，例如剃除體毛或如何保養皮膚。所有這些東西在社會中都被賦予了性別，尤其是服裝和髮型。


<!-- While the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the business fashion craze of the 80s did wonders for blurring the gap between masculine and feminine presentation (largely by normalizing masc fashion as androgynous), there are still enormous pressures to conform to traditional gender norms. Gender non-conforming dress is so instantly marked as queer that any time a woman wears a tailored suit she is marked as a lesbian, and a dad who [puts on an Elsa costume because his son wants to have a Frozen party](https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/1088441623846023168?lang=en) is labeled as subversive and abusing his child. -->

雖然 1960 年代的性革命和 1980 年代的商務時尚熱潮確實模糊了男性和女性表現之間的界限（主要是透過將男性時尚正常化為中性），但仍然存在著巨大的壓力，要求人們遵守傳統的性別規範。不符合性別規範的服裝會立即被標記為酷兒，以至於任何時候一個女人穿著剪裁合身的西裝，她就會被標記為女同性戀，而一個[因為兒子想要舉辦冰雪奇緣派對而穿上艾莎服裝的爸爸](https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/1088441623846023168?lang=en)則被貼上顛覆和虐待孩子的標籤。

<!-- Long hair on men has been seen as [an act of rocker rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w7CrxLj36I) for decades, and men with long hair get discriminated against as being layabouts and bums. Short hair on women is often read as queer or butch (unless they're old, then it's expected), and women are often pressured to keep their hair long. Pierced ears on men became somewhat more normalized in the 90s, but are still seen as an act of rebellion, and some employers won't allow men to wear earrings. Makeup on men is so stigmatized by toxic masculinity that even men who *like* makeup feel pressured to avoid it. -->

幾十年來，男性的長髮一直被視為[搖滾叛逆的行為](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w7CrxLj36I)，留長髮的男性會被歧視為懶漢和遊民。女性的短髮通常被解讀為酷兒或女同性戀的 T（除非她們年紀大了，那短髮就是預期的），而且女性經常承受留長髮的壓力。男性穿耳洞在 90 年代變得更加正常化，但仍然被視為一種叛逆行為，有些雇主不允許男性戴耳環。化妝在男性身上被有害的男子氣概所污名化，以至於即使 *喜歡* 化妝的男性也感到壓力，不得不避免化妝。

<!-- Like it or not, presentation is gendered, and it is extremely common for trans people to want to present themselves in the fashion of their true gender, and a desire to be free of the shackles of gendered presentation is common among all trans people, regardless of where they sit on the gender spectrum. For AMAB individuals they may manifest as a wish to incorporate more feminine elements; for AFABs it may manifest as a want for a more masculine appearance. This may come as a full push towards the opposite of their assigned gender, or a desire to seek a middle-ground in pursuit of androgyny. It may even simply be a wish to *not* present as your assigned gender. -->

無論你喜不喜歡，表現都被賦予了性別，跨性別者想要以他們真實性別的方式來表現自己是非常普遍的，而擺脫性別表現束縛的願望在所有跨性別者中都很常見，無論他們處於性別光譜的哪個位置。對於出生時指定性別為男性(AMAB)的人來說，這可能表現為希望融入更多女性化的元素；對於出生時指定性別為女性(AFAB)的人來說，這可能表現為想要更男性化的外表。這可能表現為完全朝著與他們指定性別相反的方向發展，或者渴望在追求中性的過程中找到一個中間地帶。它甚至可能只是一種 *不想* 以你被指定的性別來表現的願望。


<!-- **Not all transfems present feminine, not all transmascs present masculine, and not all non-binary people seek androgyny. Butch AMAB trans people are valid; femme AFAB trans people are valid. Presentation is not gender; gender is not presentation.** -->

**並非所有跨性別女性都表現得女性化，並非所有跨性別男性都表現得男性化，也並非所有非二元性別的人都追求中性。表現得陽剛的出生指定性別男性(AMAB)者是合理的；表現得陰柔的出生指定性別女性者也是合理的。表現不是性別；性別不是表現。**

<!-- Presentational dysphoria typically appears early on in the form of a fascination with the styling of another gender, and a wish to be able to present as people of that gender do. That desire may be fulfilled somewhat by seeking out styling that is unisex, but typically that wish is self-gatekept by statements of "I'm not confident enough to attempt that." AMABs often run into issue here where this desire often gets trapped behind heteronormative expectations, causing an interest in feminine presentation to be misinterpreted as sexual desire. -->

表現不安通常在早期以對另一種性別的造型著迷的形式出現，並希望能夠像該性別的人一樣表現。這種願望可能透過尋找中性風格的造型來得到一定程度的滿足，但通常這種願望會被「我沒有足夠的信心去嘗試」這樣的陳述所自我設限。出生指定性別男性者(AMAB)經常在這裡遇到問題，這種願望常常被困在異性戀霸權的期望背後，導致對女性化表現的興趣被誤解為性慾。

<!-- Post-transition presentational dysphoria is usually simply a case of high discomfort when attempting to present as one's assigned gender. It may not even be about how one looks, but just the way the clothing makes you feel. For the first year and a half of my own transition I could not bear to wear unisex t-shirts because they just made me feel more masculine. Even now I have to cut the collars out of them because the close neck makes me feel dysphoric. -->

轉變後的表現不安通常只是在試圖以其指定性別來表現時的高度不適感。它甚至可能與一個人的外表無關，而只是與衣服給你的感覺有關。在我自己轉變的第一年半裡，我無法忍受穿中性T恤，因為它們只會讓我感覺更男性化。即使是現在，我也必須把T恤的領口剪掉，因為緊貼脖子的領口會讓我感到性別不安。

<!-- Clothing can also play a major role in the level of physical dysphoria a person experiences. Men's clothing is always cut very boxy, straight up and down on the vertical and very square in the horizontal. Women's clothing is cut for more curves, accentuating waistlines and hip shape. Men's pants feature a lower crotch to make room for external genitals, and no fitting for curves, where women's bottoms are the opposite. Women's clothing is often form fitting, where men's clothing is rarely form fitting at all. Men's clothing is often made of sturdier and thicker materials, meant to be worn as a single layer. Women's clothing is often made of thinner and stretchier materials, expected to be layered together. -->

服裝也會對一個人經歷的身體不安程度產生重大影響。男裝的剪裁總是方方正正的，垂直方向上直上直下，水平方向上非常方正。女裝的剪裁則更有曲線，突出了腰線和臀部形狀。男褲的褲襠較低，以便為外生殖器留出空間，並且不考慮曲線的合身性，而女褲則相反。女裝通常是合身的，而男裝則很少合身。男裝通常由更堅固和更厚的材料製成，旨在作為單層穿著。女裝通常由更薄、更有彈性的材料製成，預計會層層疊疊地穿著。

<!-- Because these structures are meant to fit the masculine or feminine forms, they tend to amplify the sensation of wrongness. A classic effect is the way that the difference between men's and women's jeans can have a radical effect on a trans person's comfort level. Unfortunately this works both ways, as even affirming clothing can reveal how your shape is a mismatch. -->

由於這些結構旨在符合男性或女性的體型，因此它們往往會放大錯誤的感覺。一個典型的影響是男女牛仔褲之間的差異會對跨性別者的舒適度產生根本性的影響。不幸的是，這兩種方式都有用，因為即使是肯定的服裝也能夠顯示出你的體型是如何不匹配的。

<!-- I, myself, am very feminine in my preferred presentation, and I've had a longing to wear dresses from when I was just five years old. I abhorred wearing suits, hating the way they fit on my body, since they always tugged in ways that felt very incorrect for what my body needed. I refused to wear any denim for most of my life because men's jeans always felt so incorrect (women's jeans and leggings, however, feel amazing). Then as I entered into transition and began to present more female, my dysphoria struck again in the ways my body did not conform to what women's clothing was expecting (too much in the crotch, too wide and bulky in the shoulders, too large in the waist, not large enough in the chest). It wasn't until the second year that I had experienced enough change in my shape to where women's clothing was properly affirming of my shape. -->

我自己在我喜歡的表現上非常女性化，而且我從五歲起就渴望穿裙子。我討厭穿西裝，討厭它們穿在我身上的感覺，因為它們總是拉扯著，感覺與我身體的需要非常不符。在我一生的大部分時間裡，我都拒絕穿任何單寧布，因為男式牛仔褲總是讓我感覺很不舒服（然而，女式牛仔褲和緊身褲感覺很棒）。然後，當我進入轉變期，開始表現得更女性化時，我的性別不安再次出現，因為我的體型與女裝所期望的不符（褲襠太突出，肩膀太寬太壯，腰太粗，胸部不夠大）。直到第二年，我的體型才發生了足夠的變化，以至於女裝才真正肯定了我的體型。

<!-- What does this look like? Well, it looks a lot like other common body image issues: a tendency to avoid anything form fitting, leaning towards softer fabrics and baggier clothes. A classic gender dysphoria trope is the kid who wears nothing but sweatpants and hoodies. Clothes will be oversized in order to keep them from hugging the body. AFABs may prefer to wear compressing sports bras in order to minimize their chests, and avoid anything with a tight waistline. -->

這看起來像什麼呢？嗯，這看起來很像其他常見的身體形象問題：傾向於避免任何合身的衣服，傾向於更柔軟的面料和更寬鬆的衣服。一個典型的性別不安比喻是孩子只穿運動褲和連帽衫。衣服會 oversize，以防止它們緊貼身體。出生指定性別女性(AFAB)可能更喜歡穿壓縮型運動內衣，以盡量縮小胸部，並避免任何有腰身的衣服。

<!-- Internally it most often manifests as intense jealousy of the people you wish you could be: jealousy over an influencer's body shape, a strong desire for the outfit of a person on the street, and most especially envy of other trans people. This feeling often persists well into transition, because this sensation of wanting to be other people of your gender is actually completely natural, even for cis people. -->

在內心深處，它最常表現為對你希望成為的人的強烈嫉妒：嫉妒網紅的身材，強烈渴望街上某人的穿搭，尤其嫉妒其他跨性別者。這種感覺通常會持續到轉變過程中，因為這種想要成為你性別的其他人的感覺實際上是完全自然的，即使對順性別者也是如此。

<!-- ### Presentation's Effect on Social Dysphoria. -->

### 表現對社會不安的影響。

<!-- Presentation can be important for avoiding misgendering, especially early in transition. A lot of trans people feel a need to perform their gender in order to be accepted for who they are, leaning in to feminine or masculine presentation more than they actually would like in order to make up for their body and ensure that people gender them correctly. Those pursuing medical transition may find this need becomes less important as their bodies change and they become able to be gendered correctly without all of the performance. -->

表現對於避免被性別錯稱(misgendering)很重要，尤其是在轉變初期。很多跨性別者覺得需要表現自己的性別才能被接受他們是誰，傾向於比他們實際想要的更女性化或男性化的表現，以彌補他們的身體，並確保人們正確地分辨他們的性別。那些正在進行醫療轉變的人可能會發現，隨著他們的身體發生變化，並且他們能夠在沒有所有這些表現的情況下被正確地被分類，這種需求變得不那麼重要了。

<!-- Performative presentation was practically required prior to the reformation of WPATH in 2011; anyone who showed up to a doctors appointment without extreme feminine or masculine presentation risked be labeled a fake and losing their treatment under the Harry Benjamin Scale. Trans women actually would lose their estrogen simply for wearing jeans and a blouse instead of a dress, or for not putting on enough makeup. This is one of the reasons why [transmedicalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedicalism) ideology is so dangerous: it would see us returning to this system, labeling anyone who doesn't meet stereotypical views of femininity and masculinity as not actually transgender. -->

在 2011 年 WPATH 改革之前，表演性表現實際上是必需的；任何沒有極端女性化或男性化表現就去看醫生的人都有可能被貼上假貨的標籤，並根據班傑明量表失去治療。跨性別女性實際上會因為穿牛仔褲和襯衫而不是洋裝，或者沒有化足夠的妝而失去雌激素。這就是為什麼[跨性別醫療主義](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedicalism)意識形態如此危險的原因之一：它會看到我們回到這個體系，將任何不符合女性氣質和男性氣質刻板印象的人貼上並非真正跨性別者的標籤。

<!-- Presentation is especially important among prepubescent children, as they lack any significant secondary sexual characteristics. Clothing and hair are the only ways we have to show the gender of a child, so much so that if a baby simply wears a pink shirt, strangers assume it is a girl. Even unisex clothing for kids is strongly gendered by way of colors and graphics. For trans children, it can be extremely distressing to be either forced to cut their hair or required to grow it out. Denying dresses to a trans girl or transfeminine non-binary child, or forcing them onto a trans boy or transmasculine non-binary child, can be debilitating to their morale. -->

表現對於青春期前的兒童尤其重要，因為他們缺乏任何明顯的第二性徵。服裝和髮型是我們表現孩子性別的唯一方式，以至於如果一個嬰兒只穿一件粉紅色的襯衫，陌生人就會認為她是女孩。即使是兒童的中性服裝也因顏色和圖案而強烈地性別化。對於跨性別兒童來說，被迫剪頭髮或被要求留長髮可能會讓他們非常痛苦。拒絕讓跨性別女孩或跨性別女性非二元性別兒童穿裙子，或者強迫跨性別男孩或跨性別男性非二元性別兒童穿裙子，可能會削弱他們的士氣。
